# Classification-and-Feature-Extraction-of-Physical-actions-using-s-EMG-Data

Exoskeleton and wearable robots are playing an important role in peopleâ€™s lives with limb disability and other physical disabilities. The exoskeleton can help people with disabilities by helping them recover faster. One of the most appreciated and successful method is to use sEMG signals, extracting them from the subjects and understanding the information/pattern from these signals, which in turn act as feedback to the robot. This process starts by extracting the sEMG signals from the muscles of the subjects, the study of these signals should be able to communicate the actual intentions of the brain and then this information can then be carried to the exoskeleton/robot. The primary goal here is to understand/decode the information/pattern involved with the signal. For this task we are using many pattern recognition techniques. So, this paper deals with the classification and feature extraction of 20 different activities of the daily life (ADL) by using suitable machine learning algorithms. The k-NN classifier has achieved an accuracy of 94.1% for two classes.
